# Database Features Added to NYC Playground Roulette

## Overview
The app has been upgraded from using static JSON to a full database solution using **Dexie.js** (IndexedDB wrapper). This provides powerful database functionality while keeping everything client-side.

## New Features

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Storage
- **Automatic Migration**: First load imports JSON data into IndexedDB database
- **Persistent Storage**: Data persists between browser sessions
- **Fast Querying**: Efficient filtering and searching capabilities

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Favorites Management
- **Add/Remove Favorites**: Click "‚ù§Ô∏è Add to Favorites" after spinning the wheel
- **View Favorites**: See all your favorite playgrounds with "üìã View Favorites"
- **Persistent**: Favorites are saved in the database

### üìä Statistics & Analytics
- **Database Stats**: View playground statistics with "üìä Show Stats"
- **Accessibility Metrics**: See percentages of accessible and sensory-friendly playgrounds
- **Favorites Count**: Track how many playgrounds you've favorited

### üíæ Data Management
- **Export Data**: Download all playground data as JSON with "üíæ Export Data"
- **Data Integrity**: Database validates and normalizes data on import

## Database Schema

### Playgrounds Table
- All original JSON fields preserved
- Auto-generated `id` field for database operations
- Indexed by `Prop_ID`, `Name`, and other searchable fields

### Favorites Table
- Links playgrounds to user favorites
- Tracks when each favorite was added
- Enables fast favorite lookup

### Settings Table
- Stores user preferences and app settings
- Extensible for future configuration options

## API Usage

The app now uses the `PlaygroundDatabase` class with methods like:

```javascript
// Get all playgrounds
const playgrounds = await playgroundDB.getAllPlaygrounds();

// Filter playgrounds by criteria
const filtered = await playgroundDB.filterPlaygrounds({
  borough: 'Brooklyn',
  accessible: 'Yes',
  sensory: 'Y'
});

// Add/remove favorites
await playgroundDB.addToFavorites(playgroundId);
await playgroundDB.removeFromFavorites(playgroundId);

// Search playgrounds
const results = await playgroundDB.searchPlaygrounds('central park');

// Get statistics
const stats = await playgroundDB.getStats();
```

## Technical Benefits

1. **Performance**: Database queries are faster than array filtering
2. **Scalability**: Can handle much larger datasets efficiently
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new fields and features
4. **Offline Support**: Works completely offline after initial load
5. **Data Integrity**: Built-in validation and normalization

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

- **Search Functionality**: Full-text search across playground names and descriptions
- **Custom Fields**: Add your own notes or ratings to playgrounds
- **Data Sync**: Sync favorites across devices (would need backend)
- **Advanced Filtering**: More complex query combinations
- **Playground Updates**: Add new playgrounds or update existing ones
- **Bulk Operations**: Import/export favorites, bulk edit operations

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Run `npm install` to install Dexie.js dependency
2. **Start Server**: Run `npm start` or `python3 -m http.server 8000`
3. **Open App**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
4. **First Load**: App automatically migrates JSON data to database
5. **Use Features**: Spin wheel, add favorites, view stats!

The database functionality is completely transparent - the app works exactly the same but now with persistent favorites and better performance!
